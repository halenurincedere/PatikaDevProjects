# ðŸ“‹ IMDB Movie List 
We are creating an IMDb - Movie List.

Let's create a list to store movie names. The properties for the Movie are: IMDb Rating (Double) - Name. We will ask the user for an unlimited number of movie names and IMDb ratings, and create objects with this information to populate the list. After each movie is added, the user will be asked if they want to add another movie. If the user answers "Yes," the loop will start over, and a new movie will be created and added to the list. If the user answers "No," the program will end and display the following results separately:

At the end of the program:

- List all movies.
- List all movies with an IMDb rating between 4 and 9.
- List movies whose names start with 'A' and their IMDb ratings.
