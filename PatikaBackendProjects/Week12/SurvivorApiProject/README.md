# Survivor API Project

This is a Web API application built with ASP.NET Core that simulates a simplified version of a Survivor-style competition system. It supports managing **categories** and **competitors** with a **one-to-many relationship** (one category can have many competitors).

## üìå Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core 9
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL
- Swagger / OpenAPI
- C#

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `Entities/` ‚Äì Contains data models (BaseEntity, Category, Competitor)
- `Context/` ‚Äì Contains the `SurvivorDbContext` for EF Core
- `Controllers/` ‚Äì Web API controllers (Categories, Competitors)
- `Models/` ‚Äì DTO classes for request and response structures

## üìë Database Structure

### Category Table
- `Id` (int)
- `Name` (string)
- `CreatedDate` (DateTime)
- `ModifiedDate` (DateTime)

### Competitor Table
- `Id` (int)
- `FirstName` (string)
- `LastName` (string)
- `CategoryId` (int, foreign key)
- `CreatedDate` (DateTime)
- `ModifiedDate` (DateTime)

A **Category** can have multiple **Competitors**, and each **Competitor** belongs to one **Category**.

## üß™ Testing the API

You can test the API using:

- **Swagger UI**: Go to `https://localhost:{PORT}/swagger`
- **Postman** or any REST client

Make sure the PostgreSQL database is running and the connection string is correct in `appsettings.json`.
