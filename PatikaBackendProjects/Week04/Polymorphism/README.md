# Polymorphism
This project demonstrates calculating the area of different shapes such as Square, Rectangle, and Right Triangle using the principles of Polymorphism. Each shape will have its unique implementation of area calculation.

# ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements
1) Create separate classes for:
- Square
- Rectangle
- Right Triangle
2) Derive all classes from BaseGeometricShape.
3) BaseGeometricShape should contain:
- Properties: Width, Height
- Method: CalculateArea()
4) Area Calculation:
- Square and Rectangle: Width x Height
- Right Triangle: (Width x Height) / 2

## ðŸ”„ How the Project Works
Console Output
```bash
Square Area(Width = 5, Height = 5): 25

Rectangle Area (Width = 5, Height = 10): 50

Right Triangle Area (Width = 5, Height = 10): 25
```
