        <!-- Blog Post 1 -->
        <h2>A Chessboard, A Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            My journey with chess began when I was a child, sitting in front of a simple board with no idea that it would shape my future.
            What started as a game quickly became a language I loved — a way to think, focus, and grow.
        </p>

            <li>Started playing at age 7</li>
            <li>Learned from experience, not just books</li>
            <li>Found peace and discipline in strategy</li>

        <h2>Teaching the Next Generation</h2>
        <p>
            Coaching young players is the heart of what I do. In one of our recent tournaments, 14 of my students stood proudly on stage with medals around their necks.
            Moments like that remind me: we’re not just teaching moves, we’re shaping minds.
        </p>

        <h2>Champions at the Ankara Club Tournament</h2>
        <p>
            The Ankara Club Tournament was one of the most unforgettable experiences for our team. We competed under the Turkish Chess Federation and returned home with trophies — not just one, but with three separate teams!
            It was a celebration of effort, teamwork, and growth.
