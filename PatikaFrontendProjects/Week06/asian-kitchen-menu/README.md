# 🍜 Asian Kitchen Menu

This is a simple and elegant restaurant menu project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Users can view a list of Asian dishes and filter them by category such as Korea, Japan, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The menu is dynamically generated and fully responsive.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Dynamic Menu Rendering** – Menu items are loaded from JavaScript (`app.js`)  
- ✅ **Category Filter** – Filter menu items by clicking category buttons  
- ✅ **Responsive Design** – Works on all screen sizes (Bootstrap 4.6)  
- ✅ **Modern Layout** – Clean interface with neatly styled dish cards  
- ✅ **Aligned Price Labels** – Dish titles and prices are aligned properly

## 🚀 How It Works

- `index.html` – Contains the page structure  
- `style.css` – Styles the menu layout and design  
- `app.js` – Holds the menu data and logic for filtering and rendering items
